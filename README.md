# Artificial Intelligence Systems for Solving IQ Tests

The repository contains the source code used to render the poster for the Master's thesis titled [Artificial Intelligence Systems for Solving IQ Tests](https://repo.pw.edu.pl/info/master/WUT8f5ec3e75103472292bfec91bd6df669?lang=en).
The theme is based on the [Gemini LaTeX beamerposter theme](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini).
Colors were adapted to match the palette of the [MiNI PW website](https://ww2.mini.pw.edu.pl/).

## Usage
1. Install LaTeX.
Depending on your system configuration, some additional packages might be required, e.g., `texlive-fontsextra`, `texlive-luatex`, `ttf-lato`, `ttf-raleway`.
1. Run `make`.

Alternatively, you can upload the project to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and it should work out-of-the-box.
